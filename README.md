-OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: DATA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT:
*DATA PIPELINING WITH AIRFLOW:


This project schedules data pipelines, to perform ETL from json files in S3 to Redshift using Airflow.
Why use Airflow? Airflow allows workflows to be defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

This repo provides the ETL pipeline, to ingest sparkify's music data into an AWS Redshift Data Warehouse. The ETL pipeline will be run on an hourly basis, scheduled using Airflow.

The purpose of this database is to enable Sparkify to answer business questions it may have of its users, the types of songs they listen to and the artists of those songs using the data that it has in logs and files. The database provides a consistent and reliable source to store this data.

This source of data will be useful in helping Sparkify reach some of its analytical goals, for example, finding out songs that have highest popularity or times of the day which is high in traffic.
